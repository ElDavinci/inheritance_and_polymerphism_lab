Description:<br>
![Cone Image](https://i.ibb.co/BytqLYp/Screenshot-20240510-152515.png)<br>
As you can see, the Cone has circles on one side and to calculate its surface area and volume,
we need first to get the area of its base. If we have a circle class already implemented, how we
can implement the Cone class by applying the inheritance concept. Make sure to follow the
following UML:

## Learning objectives

• Using is-a relationship.<br>
• Emphasizing on software reusability promoted by inheritance.<br>
• Clarifying the notions of superclasses and subclasses.<br>
• To use keyword extends to create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from another class.<br>
• To access superclass members with super keyword.<br>
• Clarifying the role of constructors in inheritance hierarchies.<br>
• Introducing the concept of method overriding.<br>

## how to run
(1) clone repo <br>
(2) open src -> App.java in vscode (preferably) <br>
(3) run the code <br>
Simple huh :0
